/**
 * Bingo goals for https://bingosync.com
 *
 * Not adding the following:
 * - Sling because both Torch and Rising Strike are dependant on it, making it a very bad rando goal.
 * - Dash ability because it's too essential and every run will end up geting it anyway.
 *   Rushing Dash early vs. other goals is already a bingo meta.
 * - Mysterious Item, Extra Health and Canteen because they costs 2 or less
     meaning it's the same goal as any Shaman, or all Idols from a level, and many Shamans.
 * - Item Swap forcibly overlaps other goals.
 * - Mouth of Hinti St. Claire boss fight is teh same goal as getting Torch.
