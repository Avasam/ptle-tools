3. Download the zip file from Discord or zip it yourself using `pack-rando.ps1`.
4. Open this zip file and drop "Scripts" at the root of your Dolphin installation (the location and names are important!).
5. Configurations are found in `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/CONFIGS.py`.
6. In Dolphin, under "Scripts", click "Add new Scripts" and select `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/__main__.py`.
7. Enjoy and watch logs for errors ðŸ™‚

### About the .graphml file

In order to display the generated map take these steps:
1. Go to https://graphonline.ru/en/
2. Under "Graph" choose "Import from file" and choose your generated `.graphml` file
3. Under "Algorithms" choose "Arrange the graph"
4. Enjoy your map! You can freely move the dots, and you can use multiple features under the "Algorithms" tab (like "Find all paths" for instance)
5. You can also save your map at any time by choosing "Graph" --> "Export to file"

### Known issues and limitations

- To generate a new seed, simply reload the script
- Sometimes a transition does not make you enter the level from the correct entrance, but from the default entrance instead
- Some seeds will result in impossible to complete configurations, because you might need some items to progress that you don't have yet
- When using `LINKED_TRANSITIONS = False` the generated `.graphml` map will become very hard to read, given the extreme amount of connections that will be drawn
