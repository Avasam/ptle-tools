### Installing

1. Use this fork of Dolphin <https://github.com/Felk/dolphin/releases>.
2. Turn on "Scripting" logs and set Verbosity to "Error" or any option below (not "Notice").
3. Download the zip file from Discord or zip it yourself using `pack-rando.ps1`.
4. Open this zip file and drop "Scripts" at the root of your Dolphin installation (the location and names are important!).
5. Configurations are found in `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/CONFIGS.py`.
6. In Dolphin, under "Scripts", click "Add new Scripts" and select `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/__main__.py`.
7. Enjoy and watch logs for errors ðŸ™‚

### About the .graphml file

In order to display the generated map take these steps:
1. Go to https://graphonline.ru/en/
2. Under "Graph" choose "Import from file" and choose your generated `.graphml` file
3. Under "Algorithms" choose "Arrange the graph"
4. Enjoy your map! You can freely move the dots, and you can use multiple features under the "Algorithms" tab (like "Find all paths" for instance)
5. You can also save your map at any time by choosing "Graph" --> "Export to file"

### Known issues and limitations

- To generate a new random seed, simply reload the script
- Saving and Loading is not supported by this randomizer. You can still do it, but the results will be unpredictable
- Some seeds will result in impossible to complete configurations, because you might need some items to progress that you don't have yet
- When using `LINKED_TRANSITIONS = False` the generated `.graphml` map will become very hard to read, given the extreme amount of connections that will be drawn
- In rare occasions, a transition might send you to the game-intended level instead of the level decided by the randomizer
- In very rare occasions, a transition might not make you enter a level from the correct entrance, but make you enter from the default entrance instead
  - The odds of this happening increase dramatically if at any point in the run Harry died or a save file was loaded
- Sometimes the in-game audio becomes a mess and very painful to listen to. There is no solution for this thus far, but luckily it only seems to become an issue once you've had the game running for a long time

### Developing

1. Use this fork of Dolphin <https://github.com/Felk/dolphin/releases>.
2. Turn on "Scripting" logs and set Verbosity to "Error" or any option below (not "Notice").
3. Clone this repository
4. Run `symlink-scripts.ps1 "<path to dolphin-scripting>"`
5. In Dolphin, under "Scripts", click "Add new Scripts" and select `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/__main__.py`.
