3. Download the zip file from Discord or zip it yourself using `pack-rando.ps1`.
4. Open this zip file and drop "Scripts" at the root of your Dolphin installation (the location and names are important!).
5. Configurations are found in `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/CONFIGS.py`.
6. In Dolphin, under "Scripts", click "Add new Scripts" and select `Scripts/Entrance Randomizer/__main__.py`.
7. Enjoy and watch logs for errors ðŸ™‚

### Known issues and limitations

- To generate a new seed, simply reload the script.
- Some linked transitions are not spawning at the right entrance and use the default entrance instead. Known cases:
  - Jungle Canyon from Punchau Shrine
  - Bittenbinder's Camp from Mysterious Temple
- One-way transitions are not linked together. This can be a bit confusing when sometimes going back leads to a different area.
