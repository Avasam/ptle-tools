Added algorithm to account for closed doors:

- Prevent levels being inaccessible due to closed doors
- Prevent the player running into a dead end and therefore a softlock due to closed doors
- Closed doors are marked in red, and point in the direction that is still traversable even if the door is closed

Keep in mind that softlocking due to missing items is still completely possible, this closed doors algorithm is a whole different subject.\
