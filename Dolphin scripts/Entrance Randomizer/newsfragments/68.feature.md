New features:

**Added algorithm to account for closed doors**
This means that from now on, the following things will never happen again:
- Levels being inaccessable due to closed doors
- The player running into a dead end and therefore a softlock due to closed doors
Keep in mind that softlocking due to [missing items] is still completely possible, this closed doors algorithm is a whole different subject.

**Added multiple small things to graph creation:**
- closed doors are marked in red, and point in the direction that is still traversable even if the door is closed
- one-way-transitions are marked by using a dashed line
- temp disabled exits are marked in black

In order for those to be added:
- Massive update/overhaul to entrance_rando.py
- Quite large update/overhaul to graph_creation.py
