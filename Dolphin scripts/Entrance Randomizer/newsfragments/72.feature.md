When loading a save file, spawn the player in their starting area. This has allows the following (only when the starting area isn't Crash Site):

- A manual anti-softlock
- A form of fast-travel to a specific point (akin to S&Q warps, like in Hollow Knight)
- Incidentally fixes the issue where S&Q leads to spawning in the level you would've last entered w/o randomization, breaking logic.
