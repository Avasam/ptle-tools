- Guaranteed that if `CONFIGS.LINKED_TRANSITIONS == True` then all connections in the game are actually 2-way with the correct entrances
- Added all four basic 1-way transitions (the geysers for instance) to the randomization process and made them randomized as well
- Added Algorithm that guarantees that if `CONFIGS.LINKED_TRANSITIONS == True` then all levels are linked together in 1 big map, preventing any levels from being disconnected from the rest and therefore becoming unreachable
- Updated transition_infos.json to include all levels in the entire game (even the one's we're not randomizing yet)
- Updated list of levels we do NOT want to randomly pick as our starting_area
